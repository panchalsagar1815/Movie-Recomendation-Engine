# **Project: Movie Recommendation Engine using the MovieLens Dataset**

**Objective:**
The "Movie Recommendation Engine using the MovieLens dataset" project aims to develop a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their previous ratings and preferences. Leveraging the MovieLens dataset, which contains 100,004 ratings across 9,125 movies for 671 users, the project seeks to enhance the user experience by providing personalized movie recommendations.

**Dataset Description:**
- The MovieLens dataset consists of four main features: movieId, title, userId, and rating.
- It includes ratings provided by users for various movies, enabling personalized recommendations based on user preferences and historical interactions.

**Data Preprocessing:**
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
   - Ensured data integrity and accuracy for reliable model training.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identified relevant features including movieId, title, userId, and rating for recommendation model development.
   - Filtered users with a minimum of 20 rated movies to ensure the robustness of user preferences.

**Recommendation Engine Development:**
1. **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Algorithm:**
   - Implemented the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm from scratch to build the recommendation engine.
   - Utilized the concept of collaborative filtering to suggest movies to users based on similar user preferences.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Trained the KNN model on the MovieLens dataset to learn user-item interactions and preferences.
   - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy to assess recommendation quality.

**Recommendation Process:**
1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
   - Leveraged user-item interactions to identify similar users with comparable movie preferences.
   - Recommended unseen movies to users based on the ratings and preferences of similar users.

2. **Personalized Recommendations:**
   - Tailored movie suggestions for each user by considering their unique viewing history and ratings.
   - Enhanced user engagement and satisfaction by offering personalized movie recommendations.

**Conclusion:**
The "Movie Recommendation Engine using the MovieLens dataset" project enhances user experience by providing personalized movie recommendations based on historical ratings and preferences. By leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and collaborative filtering techniques, the recommendation engine delivers accurate and relevant movie suggestions to users, thereby fostering increased user engagement and satisfaction.

*Note: The recommendation engine can be further enhanced with the integration of additional data sources, advanced machine learning algorithms, and real-time user feedback for continuous improvement.*
